But Trump’s space advisors have made some things clear: they want the space program to focus more on human deep space exploration and less on researching the Earth and climate science. And the private spaceflight industry will continue to play a significant role in space policy moving forward.";

In an update today, the agency said that information collected by one of the lander’s instruments made the vehicle think it was below ground level — while it was still falling. This triggered a chain of events that threw part of Schiaparelli’s landing sequence out of whack and ultimately caused the spacecraft to slam into the ground.";

These orbits will allow Cassini to study the particles and gas molecules that linger near the rings, as well as observe the small moons that orbit along the rings’ edges.";
